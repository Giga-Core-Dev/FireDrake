INSTALL firedrake 0.4.1
Nothing to be installed here :)
This release is only for safekeeping and learning.
If you wish to have a go with it copy everything from this folder to any folder in your webroot
including all the hidden files.
Play around with your apache config untill you get it working. When you do you can login using
the username "ces" and password "lolek". So far there is no procedure to change them ;).
