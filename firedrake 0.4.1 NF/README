README
This is the readme for the firedrake firewall :).

Let me begin by saying what you need to run firedrake.
-A linux box connected to the internet obviously :)
-apache with cgi support enabled and worling
	. you can check this by running the test-cgi script in you cgi-bin directory
	 http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/test-cgi
-sudo ... altho it is not necesary, I would recommend it.
	.Alternatives are: run apache as root (not recommended)
	                   making iptables executable by the apache user (don't ask me how)
	 if you chose sudo, you will need apache's user in sudoers file
	 example (from Debian:) AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/firewall
-working iptables ... built in or modules
	.NOTE: if you have iptables as modules you should first load them in your iptables script.

That just about sums it up I guess :)
For instalation instructions read INSTALL.

This software is not yet completed nor fully translated to english!
Altho it can simplify handling the firewall you should be very careful what you input sice
there is no imput screening yet ... it's on my TODO list I promise :)

So far I'd recomend it only for learning and experimenting :)

*** Project goals:
My goal is in the first place to learn and to help others who feel the same need for the kind of program
I'm making here.
The project's goal is to one day become a nice, elegant and simple web-based interface to modern firewall needs.

The road first started with a program rushed together in bash, but I have since decided it'd be easier to do it in perl.
So from 0.4.1 on this is a perl project.

Before the program evolves to 1.0 (in my opinoin this will mark the usable state of the project) I would like to achieve the following:
	-a clean, nice iptables script
	-a clean way to open/close ports, both on the fly and for the future (stored in a  config file)
	-an effective way of forwarding internet (where only enabled clients would have access to the internet and network)
	-a clean way to forward ports, both on the fly and for the future (stored in a  config file)

Other features that are on my wishlist, that are not so important for the 1.0 release are:
	-some sort of a config parser that would detect suspicious (network) activitiy and ban cilents.
	 Also posible here would be to build some sort of interface for snort or any other such program.
	-A way of enabling new users of the network to automaticaly register for internet use (perhaps only
	 www throu a transparent proxy).
	-Interface to a proxy, especially if the former point would rely on it.
