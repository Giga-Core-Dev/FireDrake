INSTALL firedrake 0.3
Here I will attempt to guide you throu installing firedrake.
Unpack it anywhere. Then you have a lot of manual laber in front of you since
there is no installer yet.

Quick guide:
-edit and copy the iptables file to /etc/init.d
	-optionaly add them to your default runlevel (gentoo: rc-update add iptables default)
-copy the contents of the cgi folder to any folder in you cgi-bin area
-copy the contents of the www folder somewhere in your document root
-edit all in www and cgi and make sure cgi is executable by the user under which apache runs
-don't forget to edit .htaccess, create an user and copy .htaccess to firedrake's cgi dir.

#### the iptables file ####
you absolutely SHOULD take a look at that file!!!
you must edit the 
config="/path/to/config"
part!
The rest is up to you. You are not required to use provided script with firedrake.

Things you need in your iptables script:
config="/path/to/config" <this would be the config that comes in the cgi folder.

TCP:
-open
for vnos in $ODPRI_TCP; do
	  port=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $1 }'`
        ipji=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $2 }'`
        ipji=`echo $ipji | tr ";" " "`
        for ip in $ipji; do
	  	iptables -A INPUT -p TCP -s $ip --dport $port -j ACCEPT
	  done
done

-forward
for vnos in $FORWARD_TCP; do
        IP=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $1 }'`
        porti=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $2 }'`
	  porti=`echo $porti | tr ";" " "`
	  for port in $porti do;
	  	iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INET_IFACE -p tcp --dport $port -j DNAT --to $IP
		iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport $port -j ACCEPT
	  done
done 

UDP:
-open
for vnos in $ODPRI_UDP; do
	  port=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $1 }'`
        ipji=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $2 }'`
        ipji=`echo $ipji | tr ";" " "`
        for ip in $ipji; do
	  	iptables -A INPUT -p UDP -s $ip --dport $port -j ACCEPT
	  done
done

-forward
for vnos in $FORWARD_UDP; do
        IP=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $1 }'`
        porti=`echo $vnos | awk -F- '{ print $2 }'`
	  porti=`echo $porti | tr ";" " "`
	  for port in $porti do;
	  	iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INET_IFACE -p udp --dport $port -j DNAT --to $IP
		iptables -A FORWARD -p udp --dport $port -j ACCEPT
	  done
done

That said let's move on.

#### the cgi folder ####
As mentioned before you can copy this anywhere in your cgi-bin dir.
edit the config file.
set the localScript and lanScript to point to your lan.cgi and local.cgi files.
set the d_root variable to point to he directory in your document where index.html
and main.html can be found.
IMPORTANT: make sure the apache's user is the owner of all the files and it has
permissions to execute the scripts.

#### the www folder ####
copy it to your document root. Name it however you like.
Edit the index.html:
-in line 53 edit the a hrefs to point to your scripts
-edit the .htaccess  file:
	-AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/firewall
	 change this to wherever your user file will reside.
-create the user file:
	-htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/firewall username
	 NOTE: this file can be anywhere.
-copy .htaccess file to firedrake's cgi dir.
You're done :)
