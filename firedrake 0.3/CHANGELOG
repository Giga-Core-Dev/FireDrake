* Version 0.1 (22.4.2005):
This is the first release of the program, only to meet the deadline :)
It has the basic functionality, but only that.
It handles local and lan ports and writes them to the config,
lines to ensure their change in the active iptables rules are in place,
but are doing nothing atm, just sitting there echoing :p.

Known bugs:
-GUI has a refresh bug; [FIXED]
	After a succesful change, the new data isn't beeing displayed.

-Suspected bugs with rw operations on the config.
	I think some evil characters remain in the config.
	Like double ;;'s etc. :)

-Some security issues exist (don't they always? :)
	Security at this point is moderate at best.
