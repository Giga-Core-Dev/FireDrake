README
This is the readme for the firedrake firewall :).

Let me begin by saying what you need to run firedrake.
-A linux box connected to the internet obviously :)
-apache with cgi support enabled and worling
	. you can check this by running the test-cgi script in you cgi-bin directory
	 http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/test-cgi
-sudo ... altho it is not necesary, I would recommend it.
	.Alternatives are: run apache as root (not recommended)
	                   making iptables executable by the apache user (don't ask me how)
	 if you chose sudo, you will need apache's user in sudoers file
	 example (from Debian:) AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/firewall
-working iptables ... built in or modules
	.NOTE: if you have iptables as modules you should first load them in your iptables script.

That just about sums it up I guess :)
For instalation instructions read INSTALL.

This software is not yet completed nor fully translated to english!
Altho it can simplify handling the firewall you should be very careful what you input sice
there is no imput screening yet ... it's on my TODO list I promise :)

So far I'd recomend it only for learning and experimenting :)
